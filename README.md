This repository demonstrates a common error in Groovy: the IndexOutOfBoundsException when accessing elements in a list using the get() method with an invalid index.  The bug.groovy file contains the erroneous code, and bugSolution.groovy provides the solution. This exception occurs when you try to access an element using an index that is greater than or equal to the list's size (lists are zero-indexed). The solution demonstrates safe ways to handle this situation.
